# Part the first

## Title sort
From the books data, generate a file that will contain the title of all the books, sorted by title length

## Author uniqueness
From the books data, generate a file that will contain the authors of all the books. The author names must not repeat, i.e. if an author has written more than one book, he should appear only once in the result.

## Author aggregate
From the books data, generate a file that will contain data about the authors of all the books. The author names must not repeat, i.e. if an author has written more than one book, he should appear only once in the result. Each author should be represented with an object with `name` and `books` properties. The `books` property should contain the number of books the author has written, i.e. for author Kim Stanley Robinson, the data should be
```json
{
    "name" : "Kim Stanley Robinson",
    "books" : 5
}
```
